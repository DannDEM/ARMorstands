# ARMorstands
This Minecraft Data Pack adds arms to armor stands.
They don't have this in java edition so I made a data pack that adds arms to armor stands in minecraft.
# Instructions
Download the "ARMor Stands.zip" file and put that into the "datapacks" folder in your minecraft WORLD.
Type "/reload" and make sure you have cheats enabled or the command won't work.

When Loaded you should see a message in chat that looks like "ARMor Stands by DannDEM is now loaded."
If you do see this your ARMor stands should work.
# Troubleshooting
If you don't see the message you must have put the datapack in the wrong folder or you don't have cheats enabled so "/reload" may not work.

Make sure to leave bugs and issues in the comments.
